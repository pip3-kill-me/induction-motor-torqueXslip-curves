# induction-motor-torqueXslip-curves

## INTRODUCTION
This Matlab script plots 3 torque curves in function of slip % for any given 3 phase induction motor.

## SETTING UP
To start, change the induction motor parameters.

You can choose if your data is in a STAR or DELTA configuration, and wheter you have absolute rotor speed in revolutions per minute, or slip. 
Values will be automatically converted to line voltage and radians per second.
